# ML-Model-to-Identify-High-Risk-Loan-default-customers-
The objective of this task is to create a machine learning model to help Xente (Fictional bank based on a Zindi competition) identify customers that have a high risk to fail to meet the legal loan obligations.

I demonstrate my approach to answering the following business questions:
● What would be the recommendation to the client based on the analysis?
● Please provide 1 relevant & interesting visualization and describe it to the
client
● If it is possible to use external data what kind of data would be needed and How would it impact the predictions?
● What would the next steps to fine tune the model?
